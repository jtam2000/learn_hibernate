when you need to set up mysql server for the first time on a new machine
here are some problems you may encounter

1. create the root user
2. give it all permissions
3. time zone has to be set, see conf section below

4. set up the conf: notice the time-zone setting
/usr/local/etc/my.cnf:
# MySQL server conf
[mysqld]
#default bind-address is 127.0.0.34
bind-address = 192.168.1.226
default_time_zone='+00:00'
