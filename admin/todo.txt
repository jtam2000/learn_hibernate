TODO: put to practice:
    -annotation vs. config (done)
    -3 Inheritance Mapping
        1. table per hierarchy (1 table for entire inheritance tree, duplicates), requires:
           1.  @Inheritance(strategy=InheritanceType.SINGLE_TABLE) on parent class
           2.  @DiscriminatorColumn on parent class
           3.  @DiscriminatorValue on all classes (parent and child)
        2. table per concrete class, requires: (duplicate parents columns in child tables)
            1. @Inheritance(strategy = InheritanceType.TABLE_PER_CLASS) in parent class only
            2. @AttributeOverrides in subclasses (attributes/columns you want to inherit from the parent)
        3. Normalized table strategy: Most elegant/preferred: table per subclasses (not duplicate columns)
            1. @Inheritance(strategy=InheritanceType.JOINED) in the parent class
            2. @PrimaryKeyJoinColumn annotation in the subclasses, NOT in parent class

TODO: put to practice: Associations describe
        how two or more entities form a relationship based on a database joining semantics.
    -4 Collection Mappings
    1. OneToMany
    2. ManyToOne
    3. OneToOne
    4 ManyToMany

09/10/2020:
todo: go through Intellij course: Spring with JPA and Hibernate, there are somethings there that I can learn
    even though I am just focus on Hibernate and is not ready for Spring (DONE)

todo: you should definitely learn how to use Hibernate following JPA standard, NOSql is too immature for me to spend
    too much time on it, so for now, Don;t spend too much time on it, as it does not have a industry standard and is
    vendor specific

todo: First learn JPA-compliant Hibernate, THEN Learn SPRING

todo: clean up the test with Assert statments, right now it just works but there is no assertions
